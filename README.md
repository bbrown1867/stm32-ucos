# stm32-ucos

Inspired by [stm32-makefile](https://github.com/bbrown1867/stm32-makefile), this repository is an example project demonstrating how to use an STM32 microcontroller with uCOS-III. The project runs on the Nucleo-144 development board targeting the STM32F767ZI microcontroller. The project uses:

* CMake (Build System)
* GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain (Compiler)
* STM32CubeF7 MCU Firmware Package (BSP/Drivers)
* uCOS-III, uC-CPU, uC-Lib (RTOS)
* OpenOCD (Debug)
